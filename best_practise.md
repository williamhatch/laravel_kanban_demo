# Laravel Best Practices

This document outlines some of the best practices for developing applications with the Laravel framework. Our goal is to write clean, maintainable, and efficient code.

## 1. Configuration
- **Use `.env` files for environment-specific variables.** Never commit sensitive keys or credentials to your version control system.
- Use the `config()` helper to access your configuration values.
- Create separate configuration files in the `config/` directory for custom services or components.

## 2. Routing
- **Keep your route files clean.** For web routes, use `routes/web.php`. For API routes, use `routes/api.php`.
- **Use Route Model Binding.** It automatically injects model instances into your routes, making your code cleaner.
- **Use Resource Controllers** for CRUD operations to automatically generate standard routes.
- Name your routes for easy URL generation with the `route()` helper.

## 3. Controllers
- **Keep controllers "thin".** Their primary responsibility is to handle HTTP requests and return a response. Business logic should be extracted into other classes like Services, Actions, or Jobs.
- **Use Form Requests for validation.** This moves validation logic out of the controller and into its own dedicated class, making controllers cleaner and validation logic reusable.
- **Use dependency injection** to inject dependencies (like services or repositories) into controller methods or constructors.

## 4. Models (Eloquent)
- **Protect against Mass Assignment.** Use the `$fillable` or `$guarded` properties in your Eloquent models.
- **Define relationships** clearly (e.g., `hasOne`, `hasMany`, `belongsTo`, `belongsToMany`). Use descriptive names for relationship methods.
- **Use Eloquent query scopes** to create reusable query constraints.
- **Keep business logic out of models.** Models should represent the data structure and relationships.

## 5. Views (Blade)
- **Use Blade layouts** (`@extends`, `@section`, `@yield`) to keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- **Break down complex views into smaller partials** or Blade components (`@include`, `<x-component>`).
- **Don't put business logic in Blade templates.** Prepare all data in the controller or a View Composer.

## 6. Database
- **Use Migrations for all schema changes.** This keeps your database schema under version control and makes collaboration easier.
- **Use Seeders and Factories** to populate your database with test data.
- **Optimize queries.** Use tools like Laravel Debugbar to identify and fix N+1 query problems. Use `with()` to eager load relationships.

## 7. Naming Conventions
- Follow the standard Laravel naming conventions:
    - **Controller:** `ItemController`
    - **Model:** `Item` (singular)
    - **Table:** `items` (plural)
    - **Migration:** `create_items_table`
    - **Job:** `ProcessItem`
    - **Trait:** `Itemable`

## 8. Security
- **Use Laravel's built-in authentication and authorization** features (Gates and Policies).
- **Always validate incoming data.**
- **Escape user-generated content** using `{{ }}` in Blade to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Use CSRF protection.** Laravel enables this by default for web routes.
